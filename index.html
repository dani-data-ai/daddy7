            <h4>📖 From the Book: The Power of Fatherly Love</h4>
            <p>God wants to work through you to change the life of a child. He will provide the love, the encouragement, the joy, and the hope. All you have to contribute are arms for hugs, a voice to encourage or to discipline, and time for companionship. You don't have to look far to find the child. In fact, your paths will probably cross this week. And when you reach out, your reward will be immeasurable. Every child God touches through you will be changed, even if you don't see the transformation with your own eyes. And you will be changed by every child God touches through you. I was thirteen years old when God worked through Theo Abby, my Sunday school teacher, to change my life. In a real sense, I had been "fatherless." My father was alive. In fact, he was home every night, and I never knew him to gamble or drink or cheat on my mother. But he never told me, "I love you." And when I needed help, like the time when I was sick on a rainy Sunday morning and had to get my newspapers delivered, I knew not to even ask him.</p>

            <h4>📖 From the Book: The Example of a Loving Father</h4>
            <p>Then Theo Abby became my teacher and my friend. Occasionally he visited the federal housing project where I lived to see me and other boys in our class, and he invited us to go with him and his son Ted to his lakeside cabin. There he modeled with Ted a loving father-son relationship. As an adult I remembered Mr. Abby's example and decided to teach boys in Sunday school. Like Mr. Abby, I kept in touch with the boys through the week by inviting the entire class to be my guests at the Dwarf House, my first restaurant, one night a week. I soon began to see how children bursting with potential can wither on the vine without adequate guidance from adults. Children all around us are growing up without strong positive guidance from their parents, who are busy, distracted, absent, or choose to be buddies instead of parents to their children. You see these boys and girls playing with your children or grandchildren, or in your church, or in your classroom or Scout troop.</p>

            <h4>📖 From the Book: Chapter 1 - Part 3</h4>
            <p>Children all around us are growing up without strong positive guidance from their parents, who are busy, distracted, absent, or choose to be buddies instead of parents to their children. You see these boys and girls playing with your children or grandchildren, or in your church, or in your classroom or Scout troop. They're a bit quieter or a bit more rambunctious or a bit different from the other children. You may know about trouble in their homes—divorce or the death of a parent or grandparent. Or, like my friend Kevin, they may be in a stable, two-parent home. "My father was a busy person," Kevin says. "He didn't spend a lot of time with me." Today Kevin is in jail. In fact, he's spent more than half of his adult life behind bars as society attempts to mend him. The United States is the world's leader in fatherless homes. The results of our actions, according to the Fathers' Manifesto are staggering: 63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes. 90% of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes. 80% of rapists motivated with displaced angers come from fatherless homes. 71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes. 85% of youth in prisons grew up in fatherless homes. 75% of all adolescent patients in drug treatment centers come from fatherless homes. Children from fatherless homes are 5 times more likely to commit suicide, 32 times more likely to run away, 20 times more likely to have behavioral disorders, 14 times more likely to commit rape, 9 times more likely to drop out of school, 10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances, 9 times more likely to end up in a state-operated institution, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.</p>

            <h4>📖 From the Book: Chapter 1 - Part 4</h4>
            <p>Every idea that works has its basis in Scripture. Many of the lessons in this book come from Proverbs 22, from which I drew my life verse seventy years ago: "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold." That chapter in Proverbs also includes the timeless reminder, "Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it." Additionally, Proverbs 22 offers advice on common sense, generosity, control of your temper, hard work, quality work, sexual abstinence, money management, corporal punishment, and trust in the Lord, among other things. The best thing you can do to help a child is follow your instinct and God's leading. Reach out to children sincerely. Reach out in love. Love children into a sense of belonging. Let a child know you care and you're available to talk—to be a friend. Encourage children honestly, reminding them of their strengths and their opportunities. There are no magic words. All you can do is share a bit of yourself, allow God to use you to plant a seed in a child, and pray that it takes root. I have been blessed to work with many dedicated couples through the years—houseparents at our WinShape Homes, coaches in our WinShape Camps programs, and restaurant Operators who work directly with dozens of young people every day. I have learned from my wife, Jeannette, who grew up in a home without a father and relied on her heavenly Father from the age of five.</p>

            <p>I hope the thoughts and illustrations in this book help you in particular situations, but the best thing you can do to help a child is follow your instinct and God's leading. Reach out to children sincerely. Reach out in love. Love children into a sense of belonging. Let a child know you care and you're available to talk—to be a friend. Encourage children honestly, reminding them of their strengths and their opportunities. There are no magic words. All you can do is share a bit of yourself, allow God to use you to plant a seed in a child, and pray that it takes root. A good child nearby is about to make bad choices that will have lasting consequences and needs for you to step in right now. This book is for that child. My hope is that by reading about the experiences of some children I have known, you will be inspired to reach out to a child near you—a child full of potential who needs the guiding hand of a wise adult. Sometimes, even when parents and mentors seemingly do everything right in bringing up a child, that child makes wrong choices. Ultimately, the child chooses which direction to go. I would like to offer tribute to those parents who tried to teach their children well but whose hearts were broken by the choices their children made. But we must never give up. Every moment we invest in building a child's character is a seed planted for their future. The foundation we lay in these early years will serve them when they face life's greatest challenges.</p>

            <h4>📖 From the Book: Chapter 1 - Part 6</h4>
            <p>God wants to work through you to change the life of a child. Make yourself available to Him, and He may bless you with the opportunity to watch Him build and transform a life. One of Doug and Julie Bowling's foster children wrote them a letter and followed up with a phone call apologizing for all the hardship she had brought into their home. She had been an extremely difficult teenager, and she asked them, "What can I do to make it right?" That young lady had been transformed by God's love, expressed through Doug and Julie. "All I ask you to do," Julie replied, "is take care of your own children. Break the cycle of abandonment that you experienced from your own parents. Let God plant a seed of love and hope in your children's hearts." That's what God is asking you today. "Feed My sheep." "Do for one of the least of these." "Welcome the little children in My name." Let Him use you to change the life of a child, then experience the blessing of your own transformation. The power to influence a child's life is within your reach. You may not feel equipped or worthy, but God has placed these children in your path for a purpose. Every child you encounter is fighting battles you may never know about, carrying burdens too heavy for their small shoulders. Your consistent presence, your encouraging words, your patient guidance can be the difference between a life well-lived and a life of regret and pain.</p>

            <h4>📖 From the Book: Chapter 1 - Part 7</h4>
            <p>Remember that the influence you have on a child today will ripple through generations. The boy or girl you encourage, guide, and love will become the parent, teacher, coach, or mentor who influences other children. Your investment multiplies exponentially. The child you build today may build dozens of other children throughout their lifetime. This is the profound responsibility and privilege we have as adults in the lives of children. We are not just shaping one life; we are shaping the future. Every act of kindness, every moment of patient instruction, every expression of unconditional love becomes part of the foundation upon which a child builds their character. And that character, once established, becomes the bedrock from which they will influence others. It truly is better to build boys than mend men, better to guide children than repair adults. The investment we make in a child's early years pays dividends that last for generations. So reach out to the children around you. Love them, guide them, believe in them. Help them build the strong character that will carry them through life's challenges and enable them to build others in return. This is our calling, our privilege, and our greatest opportunity to make a lasting difference in this world.</p>

          <em>“Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.” — Proverbs 22:6</em><br><br>
          Disciplining children in an undisciplined society may be the hardest task parents face. I'm going to make it even harder by suggesting that you should discipline children who are not your own.<br><br>
          Doug and Julie Bowling were twenty-three years old when they became houseparents at our second foster home. One day they were a typical young couple with an infant son; the next day they had seven children ranging in ages up to fifteen. Julie recalls the first supper she served: "I worked for two hours getting it ready and called them in when I had it on the table. As soon as they finished eating, they all got up at once and ran outside to their bikes and skateboards, leaving dishes everywhere.<br><br>
          "Doug and I looked at each other and realized that wouldn't do, so we went to the front door and yelled, 'Get back in here!' They filed back in, and we explained to them, 'This is not camp, and we're not your counselors.' From that moment we began to define our relationship."<br><br>
          The Bowlings had initially suggested that the children call them Doug and Julie. After all, they certainly weren't old enough to be the children's biological parents. "Mom and Dad" sounded weird to them. Then came Doug's trip to the emergency room with their eight-year-old boy. The doctor couldn't understand the relationship between the child and the man he called Doug and wasn't sure Doug had authority to sign a medical release. Finally Doug convinced the doctor that he was the boy's foster father.<br><br>
          "From now on," he told the children when he returned home, "you're calling us Mom and Dad."

        <h4>📖 Book Excerpt: Day 9</h4>
        <p>
          Children have plenty of buddies. They don't need an adult—especially a parent—to be another buddy. They need someone they can look up to with respect. That respect begins with the establishment of authority.<br><br>
          God emphasized the point with the first three of the Ten Commandments: You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol. You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God.<br><br>
          Then, in the fifth commandment, He told us who is next in line after Him: Honor your father and your mother.<br><br>
          Although it is often said, it bears repeating: Children want limits, and they want to be able to respect the adults who set those limits. They want to know where the fence is; that's their security. And, finally, they want to know what will happen when they cross the line. A parent who tries to be a buddy will soon have a tyrant for a child. The same theory applies in any adult-child relationship. Our houseparents establish their authority with each child by being firm, knowing they can always ease up at the appropriate time. If they begin the relationship by being lax, they have a hard time imposing new rules later. That's where the next principle of discipline comes in.<br><br>
          Several of our houseparents coach Little League baseball, basketball, or soccer, and most of them have two basic rules for their team. Players must say "Yes sir" to the coach and do whatever he asks them to do. Players cannot laugh at another child who makes a mistake. A couple of our dads have even told parents of disrespectful children, "I don't want your child talking to you that way around our team. They're setting a bad example." Respect begins with the way we speak to one another.

        <h4>📖 Book Excerpt: Day 10</h4>
        <p>
          A child should know, or at least be able to predict, the consequences of any action. Going back to Doug and Julie's house for another illustration, they had been houseparents for a little more than a year, and all of the children knew the rules.<br><br>
          At a family meeting shortly after a new child moved in, Julie told them about something she had planned, and the new boy said, "That sucks." Instantly the room fell silent, and the other kids turned slowly toward him. "What? What did I say?" the new boy asked. The children explained to him that nobody talked like that in their house, and he was in big trouble. Julie and Doug had been so consistent in their discipline that the children knew the consequences by heart.<br><br>
          Contrast that story with David, a boy in my Sunday school class who was having problems getting along with his parents—disobeying them and even making fun of them. I explained to David that when he was being disrespectful to his parents, he was being disrespectful to God. He said he would do better. A few weeks later I asked David how he was getting along with his parents. He said, "We're working on it." I said, "You don't need to 'work on it.' You just need to realize who's boss. If you can't take orders from parents, you might not ever be able to hold down a job."<br><br>
          In David's case, I'm afraid the parents never established themselves as leaders of the household through consistent discipline. He would have to rely on a compassionate but firm teacher, coach, or boss to demonstrate consistency. How many families have you seen that are ruled by a child? By age five, some children already dictate to their parents what they will do. They know their parents would rather give in to their demands than deal with a tantrum.

        <p>
          I've seen dozens of children through the years who never understood respect for authority. Their parents rarely enforced discipline at home until the children were completely out of control, then they flew off the handle and slapped or hit the children. Their inconsistent message only amplified the problem.<br><br>
          Be so consistent with your discipline that you're boring.<br><br>
          Some parents rely on Proverbs 22:15 to command respect: "Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him." But the merits of corporal punishment are debatable, and the "rod" does not have to be literal. If you strike a child in anger, you may lose control. My father was that way. If we didn't respect him in every way, he'd pull out the leather strap he used to sharpen his razor and whip us unmercifully. We didn't do anything to cross my dad.<br><br>
          Many of the children who come to our foster homes have been physically abused. They've been thrown against walls and across rooms. They've been slapped hard by angry parents. State regulations prevent physical punishment of foster children, so the houseparents have to be creative in their punishment. For example, when the whole house is going out for Chick-fil-A or pizza, a child being punished might have to take a peanut butter sandwich from home. Or you can deny television or computer privileges. A child would rather get a spanking than be denied TV for a week. The most effective punishment isn't always the first one that comes to mind.<br><br>
          Paul Anderson, who was "The World's Strongest Man," built a home in south Georgia for boys who were in repeated trouble and who otherwise would be in youth detention. Those boys knew they couldn't frighten or intimidate Paul Anderson, and by his mere presence he commanded respect. But they learned to respect Paul's heart and his words more than his physical strength.

          You don't have to be the world's strongest man to earn the respect of a child or a teenager, but you have to be strong enough to stand your ground against an onslaught of resistance.<br><br>
          I have relied on the power of a rocking chair hundreds of times since I learned about it more than twenty years ago. We had not yet built our first foster home, and I asked the director of a foster facility near our Chick-fil-A headquarters in Atlanta how she handled discipline.<br><br>
          "If they're misbehaving," she said, "I grab them by the collar, put them in my lap in the rocking chair, and say, 'Let me rock some of the meanness out of you.'"<br><br>
          Now all of our foster homes have rocking chairs. I have "rocked the meanness" out of many infants, young children, and even teenagers who needed to experience quiet, soothing love.<br><br>
          You may think children have outgrown the desire to be rocked to sleep at night. They haven't—particularly children who haven't had an abundance of love expressed to them. They're eager to be rocked or hugged and reminded that they are loved. So if you don't have a rocking chair, get one. And if you have one, use it.

          A visit to a church with the WinShape Home family in Brazil showed me the power of silence. After a long service on hard pews, I asked the foster mother, Christina Stevanato, how they managed to keep the children quiet and still. She said, "They don't have an option." She earned their respect through consistent discipline, and they knew what was expected of them.<br><br>
          I came home and explained to my Sunday school boys that they no longer had an option about whether to behave or to sit quietly through the lesson. If they choose to do otherwise, I briefly stop the lesson, and in the silence of the moment the transgressor realizes what is happening and stops. Of course, the power of silence only works when children respect the person in authority.<br><br>
          If children have no respect for authority, no amount of punishment is going to change them. One of the best ways to teach children respect for authority is to model our own adherence to the chain of command. Adults can do this by worshiping and respecting God and by obeying the rules of law. It amazes me how many people will cheat on their income taxes, lie to a police officer who stops them for speeding, or take advantage of a clerk who gives them too much change—in clear view of their children. And it saddens me how many families no longer worship together and show their respect for the ultimate Authority.

        <h4>📖 Book Excerpt: Day 14 (Reflection)</h4>
        <p>
          The word WIN can stand for "what's important now."<br><br>
          One year I challenged the boys in my Sunday school class to be 100 percent on time with their Bibles, prepared for the lesson, and then to stay for church after Sunday school. One morning we were on target to meet the challenge. Everyone was there on time and prepared. The class ended, and we all headed for the sanctuary except Rayburn, who said he was going home. I didn't understand. Rayburn's mother worked in the nursery, and his sister always stayed for church, so it would have been easy for him to stay. The other boys were disappointed, and so was I.<br><br>
          "Rayburn," I said, "you could stay for church if you wanted to, couldn't you?"<br>
          "Yes," he said, and he hung his head.<br><br>
          Then I scolded him a bit and reminded him how important it was to the other boys and me to achieve our goal. We were so close to perfection! But Rayburn wouldn't budge, so I sent the other boys on to church.<br><br>
          Then Rayburn pulled me aside and said, "Mr. Cathy, the reason I have to go home now is to be with my dad. He's there at home, and he gives me his undivided attention while my mother and sisters are gone. He gives that time to me."<br><br>
          "Isn't he there on Saturday?" I asked.<br>
          "Yes," Rayburn said, "but he's drinking, and there's a lot going on. We don't get much time together. Sunday morning is the only time when it's just me and Dad."<br><br>
          A boy needs time with his father, and a man needs time with his Father. Rayburn's father made the wrong choice. But I told my young friend, "I'm sorry for what I said, Rayburn. You're making the better decision to go home and be with your dad."
