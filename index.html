                        <h4>üìñ From the Book: The Power of Fatherly Love</h4>
                        <p>God wants to work through you to change the life of a child. He will provide the love, the encouragement, the joy, and the hope. All you have to contribute are arms for hugs, a voice to encourage or to discipline, and time for companionship. You don't have to look far to find the child. In fact, your paths will probably cross this week. And when you reach out, your reward will be immeasurable. Every child God touches through you will be changed, even if you don't see the transformation with your own eyes. And you will be changed by every child God touches through you. I was thirteen years old when God worked through Theo Abby, my Sunday school teacher, to change my life. In a real sense, I had been "fatherless." My father was alive. In fact, he was home every night, and I never knew him to gamble or drink or cheat on my mother. But he never told me, "I love you." And when I needed help, like the time when I was sick on a rainy Sunday morning and had to get my newspapers delivered, I knew not to even ask him.</p>

                        <p>Then Theo Abby became my teacher and my friend. Occasionally he visited the federal housing project where I lived to see me and other boys in our class, and he invited us to go with him and his son Ted to his lakeside cabin. There he modeled with Ted a loving father-son relationship. As an adult I remembered Mr. Abby's example and decided to teach boys in Sunday school. Like Mr. Abby, I kept in touch with the boys through the week by inviting the entire class to be my guests at the Dwarf House, my first restaurant, one night a week. I soon began to see how children bursting with potential can wither on the vine without adequate guidance from adults. Children all around us are growing up without strong positive guidance from their parents, who are busy, distracted, absent, or choose to be buddies instead of parents to their children. You see these boys and girls playing with your children or grandchildren, or in your church, or in your classroom or Scout troop.</p>

                        <p>Children all around us are growing up without strong positive guidance from their parents, who are busy, distracted, absent, or choose to be buddies instead of parents to their children. You see these boys and girls playing with your children or grandchildren, or in your church, or in your classroom or Scout troop. They're a bit quieter or a bit more rambunctious or a bit different from the other children. You may know about trouble in their homes‚Äîdivorce or the death of a parent or grandparent. Or, like my friend Kevin, they may be in a stable, two-parent home. "My father was a busy person," Kevin says. "He didn't spend a lot of time with me." Today Kevin is in jail. In fact, he's spent more than half of his adult life behind bars as society attempts to mend him. The United States is the world's leader in fatherless homes. The results of our actions, according to the Fathers' Manifesto are staggering: 63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes. 90% of all homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes. 80% of rapists motivated with displaced angers come from fatherless homes. 71% of all high school dropouts come from fatherless homes. 85% of youth in prisons grew up in fatherless homes. 75% of all adolescent patients in drug treatment centers come from fatherless homes. Children from fatherless homes are 5 times more likely to commit suicide, 32 times more likely to run away, 20 times more likely to have behavioral disorders, 14 times more likely to commit rape, 9 times more likely to drop out of school, 10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances, 9 times more likely to end up in a state-operated institution, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.</p>

                        <p>Every idea that works has its basis in Scripture. Many of the lessons in this book come from Proverbs 22, from which I drew my life verse seventy years ago: "A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold." That chapter in Proverbs also includes the timeless reminder, "Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it." Additionally, Proverbs 22 offers advice on common sense, generosity, control of your temper, hard work, quality work, sexual abstinence, money management, corporal punishment, and trust in the Lord, among other things. The best thing you can do to help a child is follow your instinct and God's leading. Reach out to children sincerely. Reach out in love. Love children into a sense of belonging. Let a child know you care and you're available to talk‚Äîto be a friend. Encourage children honestly, reminding them of their strengths and their opportunities. There are no magic words. All you can do is share a bit of yourself, allow God to use you to plant a seed in a child, and pray that it takes root. I have been blessed to work with many dedicated couples through the years‚Äîhouseparents at our WinShape Homes, coaches in our WinShape Camps programs, and restaurant Operators who work directly with dozens of young people every day. I have learned from my wife, Jeannette, who grew up in a home without a father and relied on her heavenly Father from the age of five.</p>

                        <p>I hope the thoughts and illustrations in this book help you in particular situations, but the best thing you can do to help a child is follow your instinct and God's leading. Reach out to children sincerely. Reach out in love. Love children into a sense of belonging. Let a child know you care and you're available to talk‚Äîto be a friend. Encourage children honestly, reminding them of their strengths and their opportunities. There are no magic words. All you can do is share a bit of yourself, allow God to use you to plant a seed in a child, and pray that it takes root. A good child nearby is about to make bad choices that will have lasting consequences and needs for you to step in right now. This book is for that child. My hope is that by reading about the experiences of some children I have known, you will be inspired to reach out to a child near you‚Äîa child full of potential who needs the guiding hand of a wise adult. Sometimes, even when parents and mentors seemingly do everything right in bringing up a child, that child makes wrong choices. Ultimately, the child chooses which direction to go. I would like to offer tribute to those parents who tried to teach their children well but whose hearts were broken by the choices their children made. But we must never give up. Every moment we invest in building a child's character is a seed planted for their future. The foundation we lay in these early years will serve them when they face life's greatest challenges.</p>

                        <p>God wants to work through you to change the life of a child. Make yourself available to Him, and He may bless you with the opportunity to watch Him build and transform a life. One of Doug and Julie Bowling's foster children wrote them a letter and followed up with a phone call apologizing for all the hardship she had brought into their home. She had been an extremely difficult teenager, and she asked them, "What can I do to make it right?" That young lady had been transformed by God's love, expressed through Doug and Julie. "All I ask you to do," Julie replied, "is take care of your own children. Break the cycle of abandonment that you experienced from your own parents. Let God plant a seed of love and hope in your children's hearts." That's what God is asking you today. "Feed My sheep." "Do for one of the least of these." "Welcome the little children in My name." Let Him use you to change the life of a child, then experience the blessing of your own transformation. The power to influence a child's life is within your reach. You may not feel equipped or worthy, but God has placed these children in your path for a purpose. Every child you encounter is fighting battles you may never know about, carrying burdens too heavy for their small shoulders. Your consistent presence, your encouraging words, your patient guidance can be the difference between a life well-lived and a life of regret and pain.</p>

                        <p>Remember that the influence you have on a child today will ripple through generations. The boy or girl you encourage, guide, and love will become the parent, teacher, coach, or mentor who influences other children. Your investment multiplies exponentially. The child you build today may build dozens of other children throughout their lifetime. This is the profound responsibility and privilege we have as adults in the lives of children. We are not just shaping one life; we are shaping the future. Every act of kindness, every moment of patient instruction, every expression of unconditional love becomes part of the foundation upon which a child builds their character. And that character, once established, becomes the bedrock from which they will influence others. It truly is better to build boys than mend men, better to guide children than repair adults. The investment we make in a child's early years pays dividends that last for generations. So reach out to the children around you. Love them, guide them, believe in them. Help them build the strong character that will carry them through life's challenges and enable them to build others in return. This is our calling, our privilege, and our greatest opportunity to make a lasting difference in this world.</p>

                        <p>Disciplining children in an undisciplined society may be the hardest task parents face. I'm going to make it even harder by suggesting that you should discipline children who are not your own. Doug and Julie Bowling were twenty-three years old when they became houseparents at our second foster home. One day they were a typical young couple with an infant son; the next day they had seven children ranging in ages up to fifteen. Julie recalls the first supper she served: "I worked for two hours getting it ready and called them in when I had it on the table. As soon as they finished eating, they all got up at once and ran outside to their bikes and skateboards, leaving dishes everywhere. Doug and I looked at each other and realized that wouldn't do, so we went to the front door and yelled, 'Get back in here!' They filed back in, and we explained to them, 'This is not camp, and we're not your counselors.' From that moment we began to define our relationship." The Bowlings had initially suggested that the children call them Doug and Julie. After all, they certainly weren't old enough to be the children's biological parents. "Mom and Dad" sounded weird to them. Then came Doug's trip to the emergency room with their eight-year-old boy. The doctor couldn't understand the relationship between the child and the man he called Doug and wasn't sure Doug had authority to sign a medical release. Finally Doug convinced the doctor that he was the boy's foster father. "From now on," he told the children when he returned home, "you're calling us Mom and Dad."</p>

                        <p>Children have plenty of buddies. They don't need an adult‚Äîespecially a parent‚Äîto be another buddy. They need someone they can look up to with respect. That respect begins with the establishment of authority. God emphasized the point with the first three of the Ten Commandments: You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God. Then, in the fifth commandment, He told us who is next in line after Him: Honor your father and your mother. Establishment of authority begins with the name you are called. For Doug and Julie and their new foster children, it was Mom and Dad. I like for our foster children to call me Grandpa. You may want children outside your family to call you Mr. Jackson or Mrs. Daniels or Coach or Pastor. In less formal situations they might address you as Miss Katherine or Dr. Tommy. In the South children sometimes call close friends of their parents Aunt Jane or Uncle Greg, even though they are not related. All of these titles imply the authority adults should have in the eyes of children, and in almost every case they're more appropriate than a simple first-name basis. Several of our houseparents coach Little League baseball, basketball, or soccer, and most of them have two basic rules for their team. Players must say "Yes sir" to the coach and do whatever he asks them to do. Players cannot laugh at another child who makes a mistake. A couple of our dads have even told parents of disrespectful children, "I don't want your child talking to you that way around our team. They're setting a bad example." Respect begins with the way we speak to one another.</p>

                        <p>I have relied on the power of a rocking chair hundreds of times since I learned about it more than twenty years ago. We had not yet built our first foster home, and I asked the director of a foster facility near our Chick-fil-A headquarters in Atlanta how she handled discipline. "If they're misbehaving," she said, "I grab them by the collar, put them in my lap in the rocking chair, and say, 'Let me rock some of the meanness out of you.'" Now all of our foster homes have rocking chairs. I have "rocked the meanness" out of many infants, young children, and even teenagers who needed to experience quiet, soothing love. You may think children have outgrown the desire to be rocked to sleep at night. They haven't‚Äîparticularly children who haven't had an abundance of love expressed to them. They're eager to be rocked or hugged and reminded that they are loved. So if you don't have a rocking chair, get one. And if you have one, use it. The power of silence only works when children respect the person in authority.</p>

                        <p>If children have no respect for authority, no amount of punishment is going to change them. One of the best ways to teach children respect for authority is to model our own adherence to the chain of command. Adults can do this by worshiping and respecting God and by obeying the rules of law. It amazes me how many people will cheat on their income taxes, lie to a police officer who stops them for speeding, or take advantage of a clerk who gives them too much change‚Äîin clear view of their children. And it saddens me how many families no longer worship together and show their respect for the ultimate Authority. Children are always putting us to the test, whether we know it or not. We must be aware of the messages we send. When we choose not to build children with discipline but instead wait until they're adults to "fix" them, the best we can do in many cases is to put a Band-Aid on a severe wound. Life is not summer camp, and we are not counselors. A child with one less buddy and one more adult willing to help establish appropriate values by setting limits through discipline may be changed forever.</p>

                        <p>The word win can stand for "what's important now." One year I challenged the boys in my Sunday school class to be 100 percent on time with their Bibles, prepared for the lesson, and then to stay for church after Sunday school. One morning we were on target to meet the challenge. Everyone was there on time and prepared. The class ended, and we all headed for the sanctuary except Rayburn, who said he was going home. I didn't understand. Rayburn's mother worked in the nursery, and his sister always stayed for church, so it would have been easy for him to stay. The other boys were disappointed, and so was I. Then Rayburn pulled me aside and said, "Mr. Cathy, the reason I have to go home now is to be with my dad. He's there at home, and he gives me his undivided attention while my mother and sisters are gone. He gives that time to me." A boy needs time with his father, and a man needs time with his Father. Rayburn's father made the wrong choice. But I told my young friend, "I'm sorry for what I said, Rayburn. You're making the better decision to go home and be with your dad."</p>

                        <h4>üìñ From the Book: Band-Aids on Severe Wounds</h4>
                        <p>If we choose not to build children with discipline but instead wait until they're adults to "fix" them, the best we can do in many cases is to put a Band-Aid on a severe wound. My neighbor Lew Rabbit, an airline pilot, dedicated much of his life to applying such Band-Aids. Lew kept a guest house on his property where he invited drunks to come in and dry out. He arranged his flight schedule so he could be home at night, and every night, if he had an empty bed in the guesthouse, Lew drove the streets of downtown Atlanta in search of anyone who wanted to be "mended." It was never easy. The men had to commit to staying for at least thirty days, and they couldn't touch alcohol while they were there. He had many repeat visitors through the years‚Äîmen who left and picked up the bottle again. "I've never seen a man who didn't fall off the wagon a time or two before he finally got his feet on solid rock," Lew says. Some of the men were never able to find that solid rock. And it all began with a choice each man had made years earlier. "It's better to establish values early in life that will carry them over the critical years," Lew says.</p>

                        <p>God emphasized the point with the first three of the Ten Commandments: You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God. Then, in the fifth commandment, He told us who is next in line after Him: Honor your father and your mother. Establishment of authority begins with the name you are called. For Doug and Julie and their new foster children, it was Mom and Dad. I like for our foster children to call me Grandpa. You may want children outside your family to call you Mr. Jackson or Mrs. Daniels or Coach or Pastor. In less formal situations they might address you as Miss Katherine or Dr. Tommy. In the South children sometimes call close friends of their parents Aunt Jane or Uncle Greg, even though they are not related. All of these titles imply the authority adults should have in the eyes of children, and in almost every case they're more appropriate than a simple first-name basis. Respect begins with the way we speak to one another.</p>

                        <p>Children who have been lied to by their parents and others they once trusted no longer trust anybody. When they meet you, they will assume you are another liar. Only honesty and time will change them. Trust often grows out of generosity‚Äînot giving children everything they want but giving them what they need. "A generous man will himself be blessed" (Proverbs 22:9). If you are generous with your time, the thing children need most, you will be blessed with their trust. I've read surveys that show how little time parents spend with their children, and I wonder how they expect to build a relationship in just a few minutes a day. Many parents, including folks who work at Chick-fil-A, have a shortage of time with their families. That's one reason why we close all of our restaurants on Sunday, so that families can be guaranteed at least one day a week together. Knowing that time is tight and that you have only a few years to make the strongest positive impact on your children, don't spend your precious family days on the golf course or watching sports on television all afternoon. Don't consider watching TV with your children to be "quality time." You may be in the same room, but you're not together. Participate in activities with your children. Play games together. Seek opportunities to be with them on their turf. Volunteer to coach their sports team, lead their Scout troop, or teach their Sunday school class.</p>

                        <p>Then communicate. But don't expect them to share their feelings on your schedule. You have to wait patiently. When our children were young and I came home from work, I'd ask, "How are things?" They'd say, "Good." And that was the end of the conversation. I learned that when you talk to children, a conversation won't happen when it's convenient for you but when it's convenient for them. You never call a child in and then say, "Well, let's talk." The child won't have anything to say. But if you're around children long enough, they'll open up and start to share their problems or opportunities. When they do, you'd better stop whatever you're doing to listen because the opportunity may not come around again for a while. One weekend when our daughter, Trudy, was home from college, she told me, "Dad, the thing I remember most about you are the times you sat at my bedside and let me tell you all the things I did that day." All the possessions we had shared with her‚Äîclothes, a car, a nice house to grow up in‚Äîwere secondary to those times we spent together at bedtime talking. When we share our time with children, the little things often become lifetime memories for them. My friend Jeff Manley recently reminded me of an incident I long ago forgot. Jeff's father was an alcoholic, and when Jeff was a teenager, his father took his own life. I saw Jeff at camp a little while later out on the front porch of one of the cabins.</p>

                        <p>I hugged him, then we sat in the rocking chairs for a while talking. "We probably didn't talk for more than ten minutes," Jeff recalls, "but when I got home from camp, you called to see how I was doing." Jeff has carried the memory of those two little things, an arm around the shoulder and a telephone call, for years now. The call led to a deeper friendship. I don't remember all the topics Jeff and I talked about, but he remembers our business discussions. "I had never had a man talk to me about his day at the office," he recalls, "sharing with me what he cared about and asking me for my opinion. It really was neat." The thing is, I liked Jeff and truly valued his opinion. Today Jeff manages The Rock Ranch, where we have two foster homes. How do you know when a child needs encouragement? If he or she is breathing. One of the saddest letters I ever received came from the mother of a boy I had become friends with. Mike was a teenager with lots of potential, and I reminded him of that often. We talked about where he might go to college and what his career choices might be. After a while, though, I received a letter from Mike's mother telling me I was giving Mike false hopes. "Mike can't live up to what you encourage him to be and what you expect him to do," she wrote. If I continued, she said, I would make Mike feel guilty for his failure. Mike was getting no encouragement at home, the one place where he should get it most.</p>

                        <p>If his mother had offered genuine encouragement and recognized his accomplishments, they could have experienced together the joy that comes with hope. Jeff Manley overheard me tell someone on the telephone, "You need to meet Jeff. He's a fine boy‚Äîa big boy and a hard worker." Jeff says it was the first time he had ever received a compliment from a man, and he suddenly believed he had a good reputation to live up to. Accountability can reinforce encouragement. One week in Sunday school I was encouraging the boys not to smoke cigarettes. After class, Wayne told me that even though both of his parents smoked, he had never smoked a cigarette. When I asked him how he was able to avoid the temptation, he said that he and his sister, who was two years older, had vowed to each other that they would never smoke. Through the years they held each other accountable to that vow. I have often encouraged Wayne and praised him for his decision. He came to work with us at Chick-fil-A as a teenager, and now he has been operating a Chick-fil-A restaurant for many years, encouraging the young people who work there to make good decisions and holding them accountable. Appropriate rewards can also reinforce encouragement. When Richard came to live in one of our foster homes, he became the first person in his family to graduate from high school. I gave him a watch with his name and graduation date engraved on the back, and I told him I would give him a ring when he graduated from college.</p>

                        <p>Richard completed college because he knew people cared about him, loved him, and wanted him to succeed, and today he wears his ring as the reward for his accomplishment through hard work. Make your home a place where children want to visit. Years ago Jeannette and I hosted barn parties and hayrides for kids. We even had a greasy pig chase. And I often invited my Sunday school boys out to our farm to ride horses or motorbikes. They rode all over the place‚Äîacross pastures, through the woods, and down by the river. Jeannette and I tried to create an atmosphere where they could relax and have fun. In those comfortable surroundings I was also able to let them know what I expected of them: to make good decisions and to stay out of trouble. Those afternoons were like an extension of Sunday school; they saw us attempting to put into action the Bible lessons I had taught them. Throughout the years some of the boys have come out to the farm during the week because they know it is a quiet, safe place. With 262 acres, they can walk for a long time without even coming up to the house. One of the boys has told me he would ride his bike from home‚Äîfourteen miles‚Äîjust to come walk down by the river and pray. Our children have carried on the tradition of hospitality by opening their homes to large groups of young people, who enjoy a wholesome environment free of alcohol and open marital disputes.</p>

                        <p>Hospitality may be one of the most effective ways of touching young lives. Our son Bubba, who enjoys clowning around with the kids who visit, also says, "I don't mind checking the kids out spiritually. At times that makes our own children uncomfortable, but they realize that's the way I am." My good friend Charlie "Tremendous" Jones greets people in an unusual way. He gives every man he meets a big hug. "Everybody needs a hug," he says. A sincere handshake, a hug, a kiss on the cheek‚Äîall these signs of affection remind others that we care about them. Charlie tells of a man who wrote him from prison, introducing himself by saying, "I'm the person you hugged." The man thought he had been singled out, and he remembered that at least one person cared enough to hug him. I met a little boy at the children's home we founded in Brazil, and every time I saw him I said, "I love you, Michael." Michael did not speak English, and I did not speak Portuguese, but I kept repeating those words: "I love you, Michael." We played together, and several nights I rocked him to sleep. When the time came for Jeannette and me to go home, Michael wrapped his little arms around my leg and didn't want to let me leave. He and I both cried, and we understood how much we loved each other. And it all began with a simple hug.</p>

                        <p>We all want to get credit for the things we do. But if we want to instill humility, generosity, and other important character traits in children, we must model those traits ourselves. Many times that means stepping out of the limelight and letting others receive praise. Robert W. Woodruff, president of The Coca-Cola Company for more than sixty years, displayed prominently on his desk his personal creed: "There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit." I hope that whenever I give a gift to a child, that child knows the gift does not come from me but from God, the source of all good gifts. With that understanding, the gift takes on greater significance for both of us. My friend Hal King's father, a popular high school band director, was murdered when Hal was thirteen years old. Hal's grandfather, mayor of a town in south Georgia, might have stepped in to spend more time with his grandchildren, but Hal recalls, "My grandfather was a very busy man, and he lived too far away from Atlanta." Hal says I was the first older man to treat him like a friend. Hal was my friend, and that's an important distinction. If you simply act like a friend to children, they will see through you in a minute. Your actions must be motivated by a sincere desire to be a friend. If you don't have that desire, pray for it. As teenagers grow into adulthood, they need adults they can trust as friends. Often a parent cannot fill that role.</p>

                        <p>Common sense is not as common as people think. Children are not born with common sense. They have to learn it by making mistakes or by witnessing the mistakes of others. It's difficult for an adult to teach common sense to a child; you may be more effective by creating opportunities or responding to opportunities that allow the child to develop common sense. Here are a few ways parents multiply a child's lack of common sense: Give him a big weekly allowance. Give her a brand new car when she turns sixteen. Protect him from the consequences of his bad decisions. Helping boys and girls develop common sense requires a relationship, and it requires trust. I enjoy teaching Sunday school to thirteen-year-old boys because I can spend an entire year building relationships with them. We often talk about morals as well as common sense as they grow into the age where they will make decisions‚Äîgood or bad‚Äîthat will have lasting consequences. At age thirteen boys are quickly becoming men. They're physically able to handle a horse and a small motorbike, and they're mature enough to take more responsibility. In fact, in recent years I have considered dropping back and teaching eleven-year-old boys, because these days by the time they're thirteen, some children have already set their lives on a course for trouble, and they can be hard to reach. It's an important time to reinforce the lessons they have learned before they step into adulthood.</p>

                        <p>I first knew Kevin when he was thirteen years old and he came to my Sunday school class. We've kept in touch, and when he visited me a few weeks before his most recent trouble, he looked much older than his years. He's made many poor choices, and now he's reaping a multitude of troubles. You are aware of the principle of sowing and reaping: "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (Galatians 6:7, KJV). I've found that you reap much more than you sow, just as a kernel of corn planted yields much more than a single kernel. Sow a seed of trouble, and you'll harvest a bushel of sorrow. Kevin, for example, is not violent; he's just not responsible. And his irresponsibility and poor choices have made a disaster of his life. "I used to hate responsibility," he says. "I despised it. I wanted to be responsible for me and nobody else." Kevin also lacked patience. Instead of going to college, he got a job building houses. And when he didn't earn as much money as he wanted doing that, he started selling drugs to make some fast cash. Then he got caught. I'm convinced that Kevin wants to do the right thing. He's married and has a child, and he wants to do right by his family. But he continues to sow bad seed. He was riding his motorcycle a few weeks after our lunch when a policeman stopped him for a traffic violation. Kevin didn't have a driver's license‚Äîhis had been revoked‚Äîand he was still on parole after his most recent time in prison. Now his parole has been revoked and he's back in prison.</p>

                        <p>One of the most retold stories in the Bible is the parable of the prodigal son, about a young man who lacks common sense. The young man asks his father for his inheritance in advance, and the father, rather than question his son's sensibility, gives him everything he desires. The prodigal then does what many young men with easy money would do: he squanders his wealth in wild living and winds up penniless. Like the prodigal, my friend Eric came into a lot of money long before he was able to handle the consequences of it. Eric was a teenager living in Florida when he found some jewelry alongside a railroad track. An honest boy, he did the right thing and turned the jewels over to the police. After six months and several newspaper articles, no one had claimed the prize, so the police gave the jewels back to Eric. They were valued at more than $1 million. Eric was living with his aunt, and she hired a lawyer to help manage the money, but as soon as Eric turned eighteen, he had complete legal control of his wealth. The lawyer, who was a friend of mine, told me about his client, and I said I would like to meet Eric. I invited Eric to the opening of a new Chick-fil-A restaurant in his town, and afterward he came to our condominium nearby. As soon as he stepped inside, he lit a cigarette. I learned that evening that Eric was a high school dropout, that he had worked odd jobs around the neighborhood, and that much of his new-found money was going for drugs. He already was beginning to realize the truth of his new situation.</p>

                        <p>"I wish I hadn't found that jewelry," he told me. "Whenever I go out with friends, they expect me to pick up the tab for drinks and food." In other words, he was realizing the value his friends placed in him. Later, Eric's aunt said the money was "the worst thing that could have happened to him. I had him outside weed-eating grass one day, and the next-door neighbor called over, 'Why is a millionaire doing a job like that?'" She had a hard time getting him to do any work after that. Eric's brother called me recently and arranged a meeting for us. It's been nearly twenty years since Eric became a millionaire, and now he is broke. He's lost every tooth in his mouth, and at age thirty-six, he looks sixty-six. He's mentally unable to care for himself and, unlike the biblical prodigal, he has no earthly father to go home to. Eric's brother and aunt are doing what they can for him. In time and with training, both Eric and the prodigal son might have matured enough to handle the wealth they received. Unfortunately, parents too seldom spend the time to teach their children important life skills. In our foster homes we begin to teach responsibility with money as early as possible. Houseparents, for example, clip coupons from the newspaper before they go to the grocery store. It takes a little extra time, but it's a good way to show the children how much money they can save if they're prudent. All of the children have savings accounts, and I encourage them to add to it by matching their savings dollar for dollar. As in all things, some children are better than others at saving.</p>

                        <p>Some learn, for example, that they can save more money if they drink tap water instead of soft drinks. Recently I met a teenage boy with an outgoing personality who said he hoped to work for Chick-fil-A someday. We lined him up with one of our restaurant Operators and put him to work right away. The boy worked hard and soon earned a position as team leader. Then one afternoon he called me in tears. He said he had made a terrible mistake and asked if he could come talk with me. He explained that one Saturday night when closing the restaurant, the Operator had let him take home some leftover Chick-fil-A Cool Wraps. But rather than share them with his family, he took them to school the following Monday and sold them, despite our rules prohibiting him from doing that. He did it a couple more times and realized he had found a way to earn some extra money. Then he decided to sell a few more on other days of the week, so at the end of his shift at the restaurant, he would slip out with a few Cool Wraps. An administrator at the school called the Operator and told him what was happening. My young friend, when confronted with the facts, admitted the theft, and the Operator fired him. The boy came to my home and asked me to forgive him. I did, and he remains my friend. But because his behavior was a pattern of deception and theft, not just a single incident, I didn't see how we could allow him back behind the counter. My friend had sacrificed his good name and reputation for a few dollars and learned a difficult lesson about being a good steward of things entrusted to him.</p>

                        <p>Steve was doing some work for me, and one day he drove up in his car with a tag that read, "Born to Raise Hell!" "What do you mean, putting a tag like that on your car?" I asked him. He said, "My daddy gave it to me." I knew then that Steve's father was lacking in common sense, and he was passing his deficiency on to his son‚Äîalong with the keys to a car. One of the quickest ways to turn sixteen-year-old children into prodigals is to give them their own car. They don't have the common sense to take on that much responsibility at age sixteen, and statistics on accidents and deaths on the highway bear me out. My friend Mike turned sixteen and his father gave him a new car. Mike's parents were divorced, and he was living with his mother. Giving Mike a car, the father believed, would allow Mike to come visit him without the father having to go pick him up every weekend. A few months later Mike's dad told me, "Since I gave him that car, he doesn't have time to see me anymore. He's off with his friends doing other things." The father wanted to take away the car at that point, but it was too late. That would have been like taking cotton candy from a three-year-old, and he didn't have the strength to do it. Our three children had to wait until they were eighteen before they got their own cars, although my car was available to them whenever they needed it. At age sixteen children will act differently in their father's car than they will in their own. When they received their own cars, I tried to impress upon each of them that it was still their Father's car.</p>

                        <h4>üìñ From the Book: Chapter 4 - Part 7</h4>
                        <p>Our oldest child, Dan, picked out a Pontiac Firebird. It was delivered on his eighteenth birthday, and I added a surprise. On the dashboard I had a nameplate installed that read, "Custom made for Dan Cathy. Matthew 6:33." Dan looked up Matthew 6:33 and read, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you" (KJV). My message to Dan through that nameplate, which he read every day for years, was that the gift was not from his earthly father but from his heavenly Father, and he should accept and respect it as a gift from God. Bubba and Trudy also received a new automobile when they turned eighteen, and they each had a verse of scripture inside. Now my grandchildren, as they turn eighteen, are receiving a car with a Bible verse on the dashboard, and I rest easier when they're out, knowing they will be more responsible with a gift that came from God. That important distinction‚Äîthat all of our good gifts are from God‚Äîallows us to be much more generous in sharing those gifts with others. And those receiving the gifts are more likely to apply their common sense when using them. Many teenagers who appear to lack common sense are merely avoiding any interaction with adults. They have been abused or lied to so many times, they decide to take care of themselves or turn to other children for help. A child had been living in one of our foster homes for more than a year when the family was planning a vacation. The boy didn't have a suitcase, but he knew there were several suitcases in the closet. However, instead of asking his houseparents if he could use one of those suitcases, he offered one of the other children five dollars to use his.</p>

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: Peer Influence and Choosing Friends</h4>
                <p>
                <em>‚ÄúDo not make friends with a hot-tempered man, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn his ways and get yourself ensnared.‚Äù ‚Äî Proverbs 22:24-25</em><br><br>
                I recently read a survey indicating peer pressure had surpassed parents as the strongest influence in the lives of American teenagers. We must do everything in our power, then, to positively influence the influencers.<br><br>
                Teenagers and preteens idolize and imitate college students. Houseparents, Doug and Julie Bowling, take advantage of that fact by actively seeking college students with high moral standards and strong character, then create opportunities for their children to spend time with them. Recently a group of college students put on a program at the church the Bowlings attended, and the Bowlings‚Äô kids participate in the first part of the program.<br><br>
                Intentionally seek influencers for the children you want to influence, then create opportunities for them to be together. Take them to a ballgame or hire them to babysit. Then watch what happens.<br><br>
                Chick-fil-A restaurant Operators adhere to the same principle when hiring team members. They know it‚Äôs much easier to hire a good attitude than to change a bad one. They also know that every smile they hire will be reflected in the attitudes of their customers.<br><br>
                I asked my friend Kevin what he thought it might take to keep him out of trouble. This was at our lunch a few weeks before his most recent incarceration. He sat across the table from me and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the point in my life now where I have to put 100 percent effort into keeping out of trouble and doing the right thing. If I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll be in jail.‚Äù He said his wife helps by trying to keep him away from his old friends who are still doing bad things. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt walk away from the guys I‚Äôve known all my life,‚Äù he confessed.<br><br>
                Shortly after a boy came to live in one of our foster homes, he and I were talking about his mother. I asked him what kind of work she did.<br>
                ‚ÄúShe takes off her clothes and dances,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEverything but her shoes.‚Äù<br>
                I was stunned that this little boy would know such a thing about his mother, and I hoped he was mistaken. I asked, ‚ÄúHow do you know that?‚Äù<br>
                ‚ÄúSometimes I have to go with her to work,‚Äù he said. How is that child going to make responsible moral decisions when he grows up? His mother, more than anybody, was his influencer.

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: Attitude, Temptation, and Consequences</h4>
                <p>
                One Sunday morning one of the boys in my class stayed after church and told me that he couldn‚Äôt face the boys that morning because of some family problems he was having. I asked if it was anything I could help him with, and he said another woman had come into his life through his work. They had gone to lunch together and had shared each other‚Äôs problems. He was attracted to her. He was being tempted.<br><br>
                William asked me to pray that God might help him overcome the temptation he was experiencing, and we prayed together.<br><br>
                On Tuesday morning William‚Äôs wife called and told me William had left her and their three children. I was stunned. I called William at work, and he agreed to meet me for lunch.<br>
                ‚ÄúWilliam, you‚Äôre playing with fire,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúYou may love each other‚Äôs bodies, but you don‚Äôt love each other. Wait until you get sick or something like that and have to have someone to nurse you, and then see how far your love goes. And what about your wife?‚Äù<br>
                ‚ÄúI love her too,‚Äù he said.<br>
                ‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the seventh commandment?‚Äù<br>
                ‚ÄúThou shalt not commit adultery,‚Äù he said. He had learned the answer a dozen years earlier in my Sunday school class.<br>
                ‚ÄúWhat is the seventh commandment?‚Äù I asked again.<br>
                ‚ÄúThou shalt not commit adultery,‚Äù he said.<br>
                ‚ÄúWhat is the seventh commandment?‚Äù I asked once more.<br>
                ‚ÄúThou shalt not commit adultery,‚Äù he said.<br>
                William paid a heavy price for his decision‚Äîfor ignoring his conscience and doing what he knew was wrong. And the pain will be felt by his children, just as William felt similar pain years ago. You see, William grew up in a divided home. His father had a problem with alcohol and left his family for another woman. Young people are naturally curious about drugs, alcohol, and sex. They want to experiment, and they tell themselves, ‚ÄúOne time won‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù So they try it just once, and nothing bad happens. They don‚Äôt get caught. The girl didn‚Äôt get pregnant. So they try it again, and before they know it, they‚Äôre hooked.

                <p>
                One of my boys got into trouble, and he came to me because he knew I cared about him. ‚ÄúI just tried it one time,‚Äù he said, and he went on to describe the circumstances. He didn‚Äôt want to tell his parents what had happened, and he wanted my help.<br>
                ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way I can help you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just going to have to face up to your parents, and they‚Äôre going to have to help you.‚Äù<br><br>
                The word <em>sex</em> was never spoken in my home when I was a child. My mother, my dad, and my Sunday school teacher never mentioned sex. Sex was not taught in school when I was coming along. The only place I found adults talking about sex was on the radio program <em>Adult Adults And</em>.<br><br>
                Today, young people are getting too much sex ‚Äúeducation‚Äù from television, magazines, and the Internet. If our children are to remain pure, we must do three things: Pray for them, model purity, and talk to them about remaining pure. This is your responsibility as a parent. It‚Äôs your job. When I talk with young people about sex, I tell them how important it is to present their bodies to their spouse unstained‚Äîto remain a virgin until marriage. What a gift you can give your mate! If you choose otherwise, I tell them, it reminds me of the merchandise you find in the bargain basement of the department store.

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: Commitment and Modeling Purity</h4>
                <p>
                Some churches encourage their young people to sign a commitment that they will abstain from sex until they‚Äôre married. If a child decides in advance to remain pure, it‚Äôs a lot easier to keep that commitment when temptation comes. When our daughter, Trudy, was thirteen, Jeannette and I gave her a ring and explained why we were giving it to her. ‚ÄúThis ring is a symbol of the commitment you‚Äôve made to remain pure,‚Äù we told her, ‚Äúa commitment made by my parents based on God‚Äôs Holy Word. This ring will be a constant reminder to me of God‚Äôs great love and faithfulness to live His life through me. Whenever tempted to give in to my sexual desires, this ring will help me recall Psalm 46:1, ‚ÄòGod is my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>
                Upon receiving this ring, I also promise to abstain from any use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. With this commitment, I can present to my future wife a vessel clean and beautiful. In turn, I ask the Lord to give to me a wife whose purity matches my own.<br><br>
                I remind teenagers that one of the quickest ways to find themselves in compromising situations is through alcohol.<br><br>
                I learned from my children the power of modeling abstinence. Years ago, when I was actively involved in the Georgia Restaurant Association, I attended events where wine was served, and occasionally I would have a glass. Then when our children came along, Jeannette and I decided never to have wine at our table. Our children were watching us closely, and we didn‚Äôt want to send the wrong message about what we said and did.

                When they got home, their seven-year-old son asked, ‚ÄúDad, did you drink any wine or anything?‚Äù<br>
                Zig admitted that they had, and he recalls, ‚ÄúIf I live to be 1,000, I‚Äôll never forget his exact words. He looked right at me and softly said, ‚ÄòDad, I can‚Äôt tell you how disappointed I am in you.‚Äô‚Äù<br><br>

                We must do more than talk. Preachers will preach on the subject, and youth directors will talk with their young people about it. But we must do more than talk.

                Children are watching everything we do. The world is also testing us. Our faith is being tested, and so is our commitment to our children. Our actions today ripple into the future, shaping the next generation. The investment we make in becoming the right influence, in modeling purity, in offering guidance and friendship, will be felt for years to come. As we close this week, let‚Äôs remember that our words matter, but our example matters more.<br><br>
                Family, friends, mentors‚Äîthe right crowd‚Äîform the environment where children thrive. Let‚Äôs be intentional about the company we keep and the example we set, for the sake of all those who look up to us.

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: The Gift of Stability</h4>
                <p>
                <em>‚ÄúDrive out the mocker, and out goes strife; quarrels and insults are ended.‚Äù ‚Äî Proverbs 22:10</em><br><br>
                The greatest gift you can give children is a stable home to grow up in. Children who do not have stability at home seek stable relationships with other adults. Live up to your marriage commitment, and children are more likely to trust you and believe that you will not shirk your commitment to them. Michael O'Kelley and his six brothers were in turmoil when I met them. Michael was the youngest at eight years old, and the oldest, Terry, was eighteen and trying to keep his mother‚Äôs dying wish to hold the family together. Three years earlier, when their mother lay on her deathbed, Terry had promised her that he would keep the boys together after she was gone. They all moved in with their grandfather until he died. Their father, who had abandoned them earlier, returned long enough to sell whatever assets he could find and then disappeared again.<br><br>
                I contacted the O‚ÄôKelleys and got to know them, then I helped get them into the egg business with three chicken houses and a three-bedroom farmhouse. I even moved in with them for several days to help them get started, and every morning the seven boys and I went out to gather eggs. They all worked hard, even eight-year-old Jason. The O‚ÄôKelley brothers were totally committed to one another. But you can ask an eighteen-year-old boy to assume financial responsibility for six younger brothers, and that‚Äôs what Terry tried to do. As the boys‚Äô egg business prospered, they purchased a Suburban so they could all fit in one vehicle. By Thanksgiving of that year, they had traded the Suburban for a Camaro and a pickup truck. They were more interested in meeting their personal desires than their needs. They were typical boys with no adult to rein them in. All the time, however, they continued to work hard in the egg business. Otherwise, they would not have survived.

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: Breaking the Cycle of Instability</h4>
                <p>
                When a fire in one of their henhouses put the boys out of business, Terry and Tommy found jobs‚ÄîTerry in a poultry processing plant and Tommy as a diesel mechanic. That left the younger boys with even less supervision. To make things worse, the younger boys were exposed to bad influences. Michael says, ‚ÄúMy life would have turned out differently if I had been exposed to the right people instead of some of the people I was exposed to. The difference is in the way you‚Äôre raised.‚Äù<br><br>
                Michael stayed a few years, then went back to live with Terry, who had married but had never finished school. Michael, who was twelve when he arrived at WinShape Homes, stayed until he graduated from high school. He is now married with three children, and he reflects on his years with Julie and Doug, ‚ÄúAll of my brothers dropped out of school,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut Doug and Julie stuck with me all the way through. I was never a rocket scientist, but they convinced me that if I graduated, I could accomplish something.‚Äù<br><br>
                One brother out of seven finished high school, and it was the boy who stayed in the stable home with two parents. He told Doug and Julie that he is trying to do for his children what they did for him. He and Sarah are providing a stable environment for their family, breaking the generational cycle of instability. I believe if Doug and Julie or another loving couple had been able to take all seven boys into their home, more of them might have finished high school and created stable homes for their own families.

                <p>
                When a child comes to live in one of our foster homes, we tell him or her, ‚ÄúThis will be your home forever. This is the home you will bring your children back to so they can see where you grew up.‚Äù The homes don‚Äôt change, and neither do the houseparents. In fact, the houseparents or I will occasionally become legal guardian for a child to maintain our relationship. We believe becoming a foster parent is not just a job; it‚Äôs a lifetime commitment. Children whose early lives were fraught with upheaval don‚Äôt like even minor changes. After fourteen years, we changed the color of a foster home from blue to white. Children who had grown up in the home, then left and married, were so upset they called to ask why we had painted their home. That‚Äôs how much it meant to them.

                <p>
                Children whose early lives were fraught with upheaval don‚Äôt like even minor changes. After fourteen years, we changed the color of a foster home from blue to white. Children who had grown up in the home, then left and married, were so upset they called to ask why we had painted their home. That‚Äôs how much it meant to them. Stability isn‚Äôt about things never changing, but about keeping the most important things‚Äîlove, presence, and commitment‚Äîunchanging. Even when the world around us shifts, the family can be a constant. Remind children that while houses and circumstances might change, the love and values inside your home remain the same.

                <p>
                I give the boys in my Sunday school class a questionnaire every year, and one of the questions I ask is, ‚ÄúIf you could change anything in your home, what would it be?‚Äù The number one answer year after year: ‚ÄúI would stop the arguing.‚Äù<br><br>
                Arguing is the prime source of instability in our homes. We‚Äôre all guilty to some extent of arguing, and it can have a devastating effect on our children. Being in the company of anybody who is arguing, whether it‚Äôs two business people, two waitresses, or whatever they might be, makes me uncomfortable. Children feel even more uncomfortable because they don‚Äôt have the maturity to understand that arguments don‚Äôt necessarily mean the end of a relationship. Parents may usher their children off to bed, solve their problem, but fail to tell the children, who wake up the next morning with memories of the disagreement. We‚Äôre all guilty to some extent of arguing, and it can have a devastating effect on our children. So ‚Äúdrive out the mocker‚Äù as Proverbs 22:10 insists. Stop the insults and sarcasm, and the strife will soon subside.

                <p>
                One morning after Sunday school, another of my boys told me his parents were having problems. They were fighting all the time, and he was worried they would divorce. I told him to tell his parents that they needed to set an example for him and provide a place of security for his children. The arguing in many marriages begins, I believe, because young people believe the goal of marriage is happiness. Everything looked rosy on that moonlit night in the convertible where they fell in love. Six months after the honeymoon is over and the bills start coming in, they find out marriage is not what it‚Äôs cracked up to be.<br><br>
                The daughter of a Chick-fil-A Operator was fortunate to learn that lesson early. She insisted that her father hire her boyfriend to work at the restaurant, and the father gave in and hired the boy. After he worked there a few weeks, the Operator could see the boy wasn‚Äôt the right person for his daughter. He wasn‚Äôt a bad boy, just not the right one for her. So he fired him, and the daughter was furious with her father. But a few months later, she came to him and said, ‚ÄúDad, I see now what you were talking about. I don‚Äôt think I would have seen it if you hadn‚Äôt fired him.‚Äù

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: Commitment, Endurance, and the Long View</h4>
                <p>
                Parents must live out their covenant so their children can see it every day. There have been times in our marriage when Jeannette and I have not seen matters eye to eye. We‚Äôve had to pray and ask God to help us overcome problems that arose. We may have disagreed about how to discipline the children or other issues, but we both know that we will always be faithful to each other.<br><br>
                We modeled our faithfulness before our children, and now they practice faithfulness with their spouses. I believe our twelve grandchildren, having lived with faithful parents, will be faithful to their spouses as well.<br><br>
                I know a woman who told me, ‚ÄúMy husband is running around on me,‚Äù she said. I asked her to think seriously about what she was doing‚Äîto consider the children, who ranged in age from nine to seventeen. ‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs running around on you and you‚Äôre going to be separated and eventually divorced,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthen he‚Äôs going to have the same rights as you for visiting the children. Wait until the day comes when he and his girlfriend come by to pick up your three children to spend the weekend with them. How are you going to react to that?‚Äù That‚Äôs when the sword stabs the hardest, when you see an outsider coming to pick up your children, taking them away to be in her home.<br><br>
                I absolutely condemn what her husband was doing, but I also reminded her that sometimes it‚Äôs better to put up with what you‚Äôre dealing with now than to suffer the consequences of divorce. The effects of instability in the home can be felt for generations.

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: The Value of a Good Name</h4>
                <p>
                <em>‚ÄúA good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.‚Äù ‚Äî Proverbs 22:1 (KJV)</em><br><br>
                A grade-school teacher gave me a tool for living that I have carried in my heart ever since. Each week she asked us to memorize a Bible verse and bring it to school on Monday morning. Then she chose one verse, wrote it on the blackboard along with the student‚Äôs name, and it stayed there all week. One Monday morning I brought to school Proverbs 22:1: ‚ÄúA good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.‚Äù Our teacher selected my verse that week. Every day I walked in the room and saw the verse up there with my name beside it, and it made me feel good.<br><br>
                Ever since that Monday morning, I have carried Proverbs 22:1 in my heart. It reminds me to tell the truth so that people will trust me, and to pay my debts on time. It reminds me to seek friendships and loving relationships more than the wealth of the world. Trudy never forgot a childhood incident that taught her the price of a good name. Jeannette had taken Trudy to her piano lesson, and as they left the teacher‚Äôs home, Trudy picked up a penny sitting on a table. When they were in the car, Jeannette saw the penny and asked Trudy where she had gotten it.<br><br>
                Trudy told her, and Jeannette said, ‚ÄúYou need to take that penny back to him. It‚Äôs not yours.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut Mom,‚Äù Trudy said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a penny. He won‚Äôt even miss it.‚Äù Jeannette explained that stealing was stealing, no matter how small the theft, and made Trudy take the penny back to her music teacher. Trudy was embarrassed when she returned the penny, but she learned a lesson that stayed with her for life: A good name is built by doing the right thing, even in small matters.

                When he was eight years old, he came to our WinShape Homes and lived with Sonny and Deenie Brooks, who gave him more stability than he had ever experienced. By the time he was twelve, he said their love had led him to ‚Äúa complete change.‚Äù He wanted his identity to reflect that change, so he went through the legal process of changing his name. He took his new first name from David Dollar, a foster dad who had been an important positive role model for him when he was younger, his middle name from David Dollar‚Äôs son James, who had looked up to Brandon as a role model himself and reminded him of the importance of being a good example.<br><br>
                Brandon told me, ‚ÄúWhen I was younger, I asked my real dad if I could change my name, and he refused. I asked him again when I was sixteen, and he refused again. When I asked him a year later, he took a picture of me and tore it up, then told me never to mention a name change again.‚Äù So he asked people to call him Mack, and as soon as he turned eighteen, he had his legal name changed as well. Changing his name was more than a legal act; it was a declaration that he wanted to be identified with those who lived with integrity and love.

                <p>
                Some people are just waiting for the challenge of a positive association that they can live up to. In 1972, I invited one of my former Sunday school boys, Wayne Farr, to operate a Chick-fil-A restaurant. Wayne was twenty-three years old and looked nineteen, and some of the older Operators called him ‚ÄúHigh School Harry.‚Äù Wayne believed the others were questioning my judgment for selling a franchise to such a youngster, and he says today, ‚ÄúI was passionate that I was not going to let Truett down.‚Äù Wayne lived up to the challenge, and more than thirty years later, he remains one of our top Operators.<br><br>
                We‚Äôve contrasted that experience with another young Operator, Mark, who also had a new identity: Chick-fil-A Operator, and he was determined to live up to it. He refused to quit, even on mornings when he was so exhausted he wept in the shower. ‚ÄúThere was no going back,‚Äù he says. He matured quickly, learned how to delegate and train others, and after a couple of years, he had his restaurant humming.

                Having a name to live up to means a child has acknowledged something or someone is greater than himself and has taken the first step toward humility. Christ acknowledged the importance of humility in the Sermon on the Mount when He said the meek would inherit the earth. One of His last acts before His death was to kneel down and wash the feet of His disciples‚Äîat the same meal where the disciples had argued over who among them would be the greatest. They still didn‚Äôt get it, so Jesus, through this act of great humility, gave those closest to Him an example of the kind of humble leadership He wanted them to demonstrate to the world.<br><br>
                Dan was conveying the same message to the graduates when he gave them their own shoe brushes‚Äîleadership development tools, he called them.

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: Modeling Humility</h4>
                <p>
                You can‚Äôt make a child be humble any more than you can make a child love. But you can teach humility to a child by modeling it yourself. Dan demonstrates humility by being willing to tackle any job in the restaurant by occasionally mopping the floors or cleaning the bathrooms‚Äîeven though those jobs fall under someone else‚Äôs responsibilities.<br><br>
                If Dan, who is now president of Chick-fil-A, sees a piece of paper in a parking lot‚Äînot just a Chick-fil-A parking lot‚Äîhe picks it up and throws it away. When he‚Äôs in a restaurant, he helps customers carry their trays to their tables. A traveling companion was surprised when I took his suitcase from a baggage carousel at the airport. I wasn‚Äôt trying to make a point of being humble; I was just helping a friend with his luggage.<br><br>
                Likewise, at home, a father should be willing to do what needs to be done for the greatest institution in the world, the family. When our children see us serving others, they begin to understand that they also should serve.

                <h4>üìñ From the Book: Practicing Humility, Breaking the Cycle, and Week 7 Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                We reinforce humility through practice. All three of our children, Dan, Bubba, and Trudy, learned to serve while working alongside Jeannette and me at our first restaurant, the Dwarf House. It was a matter of necessity in our family business. When they were very young, they dressed up like dwarfs and sang to customers while I worked behind the counter.<br><br>
                Trudy and John moved to Brazil for ten years to serve the people there as missionaries. Their children grew up serving rice and beans to neighbors who otherwise might have gone hungry. After they came home, their son John went to Auburn University, where he tried out for the football team. He made the team as a third-string kicker, which meant he dressed out for a few games, but he had little chance of actually kicking in one. Still, he had to attend every practice, hold the ball for the other kickers, then gather all the balls after practice, experiencing the satisfaction of serving his team.<br><br>
                That young lady had been transformed by God‚Äôs love, expressed through Doug and Julie. ‚ÄúAll I ask you to do,‚Äù Julie replied, ‚Äúis take care of your own children. Break the cycle of abandonment that you experienced from your own parents. Let God plant a seed of love and hope in your children‚Äôs hearts.‚Äù<br><br>
                <strong>Week 7 Reflection:</strong> A good name is built day by day, through honesty, humility, and service‚Äîespecially in your own family. As this journey ends, celebrate every act of integrity and kindness, and commit together to continue building a good name for your family and for generations to come.
