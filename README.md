# 7-Week Character Building Journey

This project is a deeply personal web-based tool created for me and my children to embark on a 7-week journey of character building and growth together. Inspired by the book *It's Better to Build Boys Than Mend Men* by S. Truett Cathy, the tool is fully customized to our family’s unique routines, values, and personalities.

## Purpose

To create a memorable, intentional, and loving experience for me and my kids as we grow together in character, using technology as a gentle guide and record keeper on our shared journey.

## Features

- **Personalized Structure:** Each week is tailored with specific activities, reflections, and goals for each of my children (Elias 🦁, Lucas 🏇, Miriam 🌸, Cati ❤️), allowing us to track daily progress in a way that’s meaningful for our family.
- **Private Tracking:** All progress is tracked locally in the browser. No data is collected or shared—this is our private family journey.
- **Daily and Weekly Focus:** The tool organizes each day and week with collapsible sections and checkboxes to help us stay engaged and motivated.
- **Custom User Interface:** The design and features are built specifically for our needs, including easy navigation, progress bars, and mobile-friendly access for busy days.
- **Guided by Love:** The rules and activities are shaped by our intentions, values, and the guidance we’ve chosen to follow, not by any external requirements.

## Technology

- **HTML, CSS, JS:** All code is custom-built for this project and resides in three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`.
- **No external dependencies:** Everything runs locally in the browser.

## Inspiration

Based on the framework and ideas from *It's Better to Build Boys Than Mend Men* by S. Truett Cathy.

S. Truett Cathy was the founder of Chick-fil-A and a passionate advocate for building strong families and nurturing the next generation of young boys and girls. Deeply rooted in his Christian faith, he dedicated over 50 years as a Sunday school teacher — even after becoming a millionaire. His life and work reflect a commitment to character, service, and the belief that investing in children shapes a better future for everyone.
